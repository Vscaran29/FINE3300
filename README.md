Overview of Assignment One Code

This project provides users with a function to calculate their mortgage payments based on three key parameters:Principal Amount, Annual Interest Rate and Amortization period(in years).

The function requires users to provide the following 3 key inputs in the specified format to receive the output:

-Principal amount:The $ amount outstanding on the mortgage
-Rate:The annual interest rate associated with the mortgage rate as a percentage (ex 5.5% would be entered as 5.5 into the function)
-Amortization period:The number of years the mortgage is being amortized over

Key Assumptions:
- The function is only valid for calculating fixed rate mortgage payments, the function is not made to handle variable rate mortgage structures
-By the end of the amortization period the principal balance on the mortgage will be equal to 0
-User inputs must follow the specified formats outlined in the inputs section. User inputs are not validated to check for errors or erroneous inputs.

Using the 3 inputs, the function will return to users the different options they have, and the payment amounts for different mortgage payment structures. 
The different payment options include the following payment schedules:
•	Monthly 
•	Semi-Monthly 
•	Biweekly
•	Weekly
•	Accelerated Biweekly
•	Accelerated Weekly

The Final output of this code can equip users to understand the different options availible when looking to take out a mortgage tailored to their specifc situation.
